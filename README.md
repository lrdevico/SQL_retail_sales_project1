## Retail sales project

This is my first personal SQL project, built to practice writing queries and exploring data using a sample retail sales dataset.

The focus of the project is:
- Basic data cleaning (e.g. removing NULLs)
- Aggregating sales by category and gender
- Filtering by dates and values
- Adding percentages and ranking performance
