## Retail sales project

This is my first personal SQL project, built to practice writing queries and exploring data using a sample retail sales dataset.

The focus of the project is:
- Basic data cleaning (e.g. removing NULLs)
- Aggregating sales by category and gender
- Filtering by dates and values
- Adding percentages and ranking performance

The dataset and a few of the analysis questions were inspired by this

While I followed some of the same questions from the video, I also added my own ideas and used this opportunity to improve my understanding of SQL.
